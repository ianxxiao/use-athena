# Athena - the Smartest Notebook for Writers
**Why are we making Athena?** 

As passionate, but busy, writers, we want to write more interesting articles. We don't lack ideas, but it's frustrating to not knowing which article to invest our time into and not having an easier way to do research.

**What does Athena help with?** 

Athena helps you to prioritize ideas, do research, and find your unique "voice".

**How does Athena work?** 

Underneath the elegent and intuitive UI, Athena uses the most powerful Big Data, Text Analytics, and Machine Learning technologies.

**Athena Suggestions** (coming soon!) - This offers suggestions of topics for your next blog given your interest and audience. More suggestions will come later (e.g. taglines, outlines, etc.)

**Athena Preview** (coming soon!) - This benchmarks and predicts how well your article might do given your topic, content, and audience.
