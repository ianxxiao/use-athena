# Athena
**Why are we making Athena?** 

As passionate bloggers, we want to write more interesting articles. But it's fustrating when we run out of edgy ideas, struggle to create punchy taglines, and not knowing how the article might do once we publish.

**What does Athena help with?** 

Athena helps you to find better ideas, publish faster with more confidence, and discover your unique "voice".

**How does Athena work?** 

Underneath the elegent and intuitive UI, Athena uses the most powerful Big Data, Text Analytics, and Machine Learning technologies.

# Key Features
**Athena Analytics** - This provides intuitive and writing-focused insights based on viral trends in your domain.

**Athena Suggestions** - This offers suggestions of topics for your next blog given your interest and audience. More suggestions will come later (e.g. taglines, outlines, etc.)

**Athena Preview** - This benchmarks and predicts how well your article might do given your topic, content, and audience.
